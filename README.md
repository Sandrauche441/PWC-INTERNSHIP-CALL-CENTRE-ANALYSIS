# PWC-INTERNSHIP-CALL-CENTRE ANALYSIS
Comprehensive Call Centre Trends Dashboard and analysing Long-Term Insights in Customer and Agent Behavior

I was tasked with visualizing the Call Centre trends data. I completed creating a comprehensive dashboard highlighting the long-term trends in customer and agent behavior. The dashboard includes key metrics such as total calls answered and abandoned, speed of answer, call duration, overall customer satisfaction, and more. It provides clear insights into trends, identifies challenges, and showcases opportunities for improvement within the company's call center operations.
